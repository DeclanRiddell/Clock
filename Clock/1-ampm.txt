VIRTUAL DIGITAL CLOCK : AM/PM


What You Should Do Before You Start:

1) Figure out how to handle offsets.  (This goes in the model.)

2) Figure out am/pm.  Midnight is "12:00:00 am"; do not set the hour
   to "00".  At noon, it should go from "11:59:59 am" to "12:00:00 pm".
   (This goes in the view.)



What Remains To Be Done To The Code:

3) Put the offset code in your program and test it.  If you put in
   "-o 3600", it should be one hour ahead, and if you put in -3600,
   it should be one hour behind.

   The "stm.py" program computes the seconds to midnight (or noon),
   so you can use it by doing something like this:

       ./clock -o $( ./stm.py -o -3 )

   and it should go to 23:59:57, and you can watch it count over to
   00:00:00.  Similarly, you can do:

       ./clock -o $( ./stm.py -no -3 )

   which should make it to 11:59:57, and you can watch it count over
   to 12:00:00.


4) Code your AM/PM logic and make sure it's right with the same
   tests mentioned above.

   Note that in 24-hour mode, one minute before 10am should look
   like this: "09:59:00 24", with a leading "0".  But in AM/PM mode,
   it should look like this: " 9:59:00 am", without the leading zero
   on the hour.
