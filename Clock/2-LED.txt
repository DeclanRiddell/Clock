VIRTUAL DIGITAL CLOCK - LED Mode


Things To Notice:


1) If the clock looks weird in PuTTy on Windows, go to the menu and
   choose "Change Settings".  Then you want Window->Translation->
   Remote Character Set, and choose "DEC-MCS".


2) There is a function, "set_title_bar()", which takes a character array.
   It copies 81 characters out of the array to another memory location,
   and then copies the first 78 to the top line of the screen.  (Remember
   C strings are terminated by null characters.)  If the string contains
   a "-", then it shows as part of the frame.

   You should make a title that looks centered, and have main() call
   "set_title_bar()".

   Caution: "set_title_bar()" copies 78 characters.  If you only have
   15 characters, it will get the next 63 bytes anyway.  That could
   result in random binary gibberish in the title bar, so be sure you
   fill in all 78 characters of the string you want in the title.


3) The View module has a getter and setter, which lets you change the
   bits that control how it acts.  Which bits mean what are listed in
   "view.h".  You can use bit manipulation to check if a bit is on,
   or switch it on/off as needed.


3) The Controller only calls "show()".  That function, in the View
   decides whether to call show_text() or show_led() based on the
   stored settings.



What You Should Do Before You Start:

1) Read "LED-layout.txt" and figure out on paper which bits make
   which numbers.  (Making sketches really does help.)


What Remains To Be Done To The Code:

** Be sure your AM/PM and offset code are correct before continuing! **

2) The View needs to put the correct bits into the location pointed
   at by "where", with the appropriate offsets, so that digits show
   up displaying the time.  (You'll need the sketches you made in
   Step 1.)

   Right now, it puts in some bits, but they're all wrong.


3) You should do something with the colons, whether they blink or
   just stay on all the time or whatever.  ALSO, set the AM/PM/24H
   indicator correctly.

   **  NOTE ABOUT COLONS: sometimes, the dots that make the colons
   **  appear to "smear" across the display.  This is usually because
   **  your shell's TERM variable is set to "xterm" instead of "putty".
